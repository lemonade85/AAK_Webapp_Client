    "li-one": "Did you ever wonder about the beautiful, colorful, cute, and smart little avian species you see in a zoo, a video, a pet store ..?",
    "li-two": "Did you ever want to keep one or breed some all by yourself ..?",
    "p-one": "Aviculture Kerala is a closed platform for the aviculturists across Kerala, this group was very instrumental in the creation of the ‘Aviculture Association of Kerala’ bringing together all the avian enthusiasts including pet keepers, breeders & traders.",
    "p-two": "We exist primarily to create awareness about aviculture in Kerala via effectively interacting within pet hobbyists, keepers/breeders and bother to share, get and disseminate information on each species of birds on their housing(cages for show, flight, breeding), diet(seasonal to moulting, breeding, standard), nesting(based on behavior, comfort, efficiency) etc.. which results in improving the quality of aviculturing accross the state. There are exceptionally successful breeders with us who can dive more in to the nitigrities on advanced breeder and pet keeping topics which we would be sharing across our social and even platforms often."
